## Prerequisites

Before running the Job Scraper and Notifier, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or newer
- Selenium WebDriver
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome version)
- BeautifulSoup4 for parsing HTML
- gspread and oauth2client for Google Sheets integration (optional)
- Python `requests` and `dotenv` libraries for handling HTTP requests and environment variables
- Telegram Bot API token and chat ID for sending notifications

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-scraper-notifier.git
   cd job-scraper-notifier
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and specify your credentials and Telegram Bot API token:
   ```
   USERNAME=your_username
   PASSWORD=your_password
   TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id
   ```

## Usage

To start the job scraper and notifier, run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will automatically log in to the job site, perform job searches based on the configured criteria, and send Telegram notifications for new job listings.

## Customization

You can customize the job search criteria and notification messages by modifying the relevant sections in the `main.py` script. Adjust the search URL, parsing logic, or message format as needed to fit your specific requirements.

## Troubleshooting

- **Login Issues**: Ensure your username and password are correct and that your account does not have any unresolved security prompts.
- **Telegram Notifications Not Sent**: Verify your Bot API token and chat ID are correct. Ensure your bot has permission to send messages to the specified chat.
- **WebDriver Errors**: Make sure ChromeDriver is installed and its path is correctly configured. Update ChromeDriver if it's not compatible with your Chrome browser version.
